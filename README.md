# COMP7607 ｜ Natural Language Processing ｜ Fall 2024

This is the course material for HKU COMP7607

## Course description
Natural language processing (NLP) is the study of human language from a computational perspective. The course will be focusing on machine learning and corpus-based methods and algorithms. We will cover syntactic, semantic and discourse processing models. We will describe the use of these methods and models in applications including syntactic parsing, information extraction, statistical machine translation, dialogue systems, and summarization. This course starts with language models (LMs), which are both front and center in natural language processing (NLP), and then introduces key machine learning (ML) ideas that students should grasp (e.g. feature-based models, log-linear models and then the neural models). We will land on modern generic meaning representation methods (e.g. BERT/GPT-3) and the idea of pretraining / finetuning.
